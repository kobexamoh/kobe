<h3 class="fs-5">Digital Content Coordinator - University of Alberta</h3>

<p>I&#39;m a Digital Content Coordinator with the University of Alberta&#39;s Digital + Creative Centre of Excellence team (which falls under the direction of External Relations). I use tools like Figma, Bootstrap, and Cascade CMS to rapidly build webpages for the university&#39;s various faculties and research groups. A recent example of my work is the redesigned&nbsp;<a class="fw-bolder" href="https://www.ualberta.ca/graduate-studies/index.html" target="_blank">Graduate &amp; Postdoctoral Students</a> homepage.</p>

<h3 class="fs-5">Digital Marketing Specialist - Breathe Outdoors</h3>

<p>I worked as a technical Digital Marketing Specialist for Breathe Outdoors where my main role was building out custom landing pages for brands carried in store as well as special sale periods. My role here was a mix of browser page development (using Magento CMS, CSS, JavaScript, and the occasional Python script), design thinking and strategy for digital marketing campaigns, and finding inventive solutions to inspire a diverse demographic with the love for the outdoors.</p>

<h3 class="fs-5">Frontend UX Developer - ALT Lab</h3>

<p>I was a software development intern in early 2020 with the Alberta Language Technology Lab (ALT Lab) before becoming a full time frontend UX developer with the team. In my time with ALT Lab, I worked in an Agile manner to help build a redesigned version of the <a class="fw-bolder" href="https://itwewina.altlab.app/" target="_blank">Itw&ecirc;wina Cree-English Dictionary</a>. My design tasks had me performing UX research and design ideation with pencil and paper sketches, the occasional whiteboard demo over Zoom, creating low-fidelity mockups, and building high-fidelity mockups in Adobe XD. As a frontend developer, I used Cypress, Django, Python, and JavaScript for testing and development in order to create a new visual experience for the dictionary&#39;s search results pages, word entry pages, and the audio playback feature for word entries.</p>
